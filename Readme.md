# Park-Time

**Problem Statement-**

Parking in Indian Cities can sometimes be very hard job and even google maps can't help as much as it might show where an parking lot is located but how to know if there is an empty parking lot present over there.

**Our Aim-**

To develop an application with userfriendly UI and UX that can solve this problem without much of pain

**Our technique-**

An Application that has integrated Google maps and using "FIREBASE" as Data set and IOT implementation to solve the above problem.

**Implementation-**

We will make an IoT based hardware to check wheater an parking lot is empty or not. 0 issend to the database if parking lot is full else 1 our apps uses this information to tell the user which parking lot is empty and only shows the user the empty parking lot and help them navigate to that parking lot with the help of integrated google maps

**further enhacements-**

after user uses navigation to reach that parking lot we will ask him to comfirm that has he parked the vechical and if yes we will save that location so that he don't have to remember where he parked the vechical and find his vechical with ease
